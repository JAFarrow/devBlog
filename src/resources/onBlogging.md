# Why Blogging?

## That's so 2000's
01/07/2024

It's not controversial to say that the personal blog has fallen out of favour. When I was making my first strides onto the internet, around the early 2010's, it had already lost a lot of the hype you might have found about blogging in the 2000's. 

Twitter (now X) had blown up and the new thing was microblogging, and that's mostly the paradigm we still find ourselves in today when it comes to sharing your thoughts with strangers on the internet. 

With this in mind, it's a valid question: Why blogging? I never had much experience with them myself, they were before my time. Well, I have some general arguments and some far more opinionated ones and I'll be sharing both as we go along with this post. 

## Blogging as Insight

Considering the main focus of this blog is to collect my thoughts and decisions on different projects I intend to work on, this serves as the main desire to get this site up and running. 

A key exercise to becoming a great software engineer is in the feedback you get on your work. It's easy enough to get feedback on the lower level decisions you make every day, which package you chose, your use of tabs over spaces, etc.

It's harder, and far more valuable, to get feedback on your thinking in terms of architecture and solution choice. This blog is my attempt at facilitating those kinds of conversations with just a little less friction that usual. 

It also serves as a long term record of those decisions and opinions. It's my hope that I will one day be able to look back at these posts, reflect and laugh at myself in my naivety. 

## Blogging as Meditation

When you find yourself in a career that requires in-depth thinking _now_, and often on multiple things at once, only to move onto the next _now_, it can be quite refreshing to take in the broad strokes of those moments outside of their context. 

I come from a psychology background and while I never went in to practice, a lot of the theory has stuck with me. Often one of the first interventions put in place for someone in crisis was to implement a habit of journaling. 

It's a good habit to maintain even in the best of times and I think why it's so effective is because it forces you to critically look at your thinking in the third person, without all of the sensory and emotional stimulation of the now. 

There's a lot of crossover between journaling and blogging, and just as much in their benefits.

## Blogging as Rebellion

Now for the opinionated bit: I've never liked social media. In trading out the personal blog in favour of the microblog, I think we lost a lot of the charm of the internet along the way.

X and the others have their benefits, of course. Being able to interact with potentially millions of people in a few moments is an incredibly powerful ability. In the pursuit of reach, however, we face the same challenge we face with scaling anything: standardisation.

There is very little room on these platforms to really express yourself besides the content you deliver. My blog might be simple in its appearance and overall hacked together under the hood, but I feel that says more about me than a profile picture ever could. 

I'm willing to risk my reach in the pursuit of something of my own outside of big techs' walled gardens.
